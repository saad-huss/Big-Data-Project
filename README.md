# Big-Data-Project
For the final project our group performed analysis of crimes in Chicago and explored underlying socioeconomic factors, using big data tools.

Here are the three datasets of interest:
1. Chicago Crimes (2012-2017) - [https://www.kaggle.com/currie32/crimes-in-chicago]
2. Chicago Socioeconomic Indicators - [https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Per-Capita-Income/r6ad-wvtk]
3. Population Breakdown Estimates - [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sxM-JajdrC7R1VZ_sHjUwkTQ0qs2z7a7jFbCblTii3Q/edit#gid=1503084939] 

The tools used in the analysis were:
1. Apache Hadoop (local cluster using Docker)
2. Spark (RDDs, PySpark and Spark SQL)
3. Hive (HiveQL)
